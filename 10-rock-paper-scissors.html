            You will be playing Rock, Paper, Scissors against a computer. The game is played by clicking on one of the three possible emojis that represent a rock, paper, and scissors. 
            
            <ul><li>The rock is the closed fist emoji.</li>
                <li>paper is the open hand emoji.</li>
                <li>scissors is the piece sign emoji.</li>
            </ul>
            Rock wins against scissors; paper wins against rock; and scissors wins against paper. If both the player and computer throw the same hand signal, it is considered a tie. You can play an unlimited amount of times, when you're done, click the reset score button.
